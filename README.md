#  Netflix Movie Data Analysis – A Deep Dive into Viewer Trends

Welcome to my Netflix Movie Data Analysis project!  
This repository contains a complete walkthrough of how I explored and visualized data from a Netflix movie dataset to uncover interesting patterns around genres, popularity, release trends, and more.

Whether you're new to data science or just love Netflix, you'll find something insightful here. Let's dive in! 



##  What's Inside This Project

Here’s what you’ll find in this repo:

- **`Netflix_movie_data_analysis.ipynb`** – The complete Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step analysis, visualizations, and insights.
-  **`dataset.csv`** – The dataset I worked with (cleaned and ready to use).
-  **`summary.md`** – A human-readable summary of the analysis (in case you don’t want to go through all the code).
- **`images/`**  – Saved plots and charts for quick viewing or presentations.


##  What This Project Is About

I wanted to answer real questions that Netflix data could reveal, like:

- What genre does Netflix promote the most?
- Are popular movies always the ones with high vote counts?
- Which year had the most Netflix releases?
- Which movie is the most (and least) popular — and what genres do they fall into?

I used **Python**, along with **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib** to clean, explore, and visualize the data in a way that’s easy to understand.

## 📊 Key Insights (Spoiler Alert!)

Here’s a quick summary of what I discovered:

###  Most Frequent Genre
**Drama** is the most featured genre on Netflix. Nearly 14% of all the movies in the dataset fall into this category — a strong signal that emotional storytelling dominates the platform.

###  Genres with Most Votes
More than 6,520 movies in the dataset are considered “popular” based on vote count — that’s about 25.5% of all movies. Again, **Drama** is the top contender here, followed by **Action**, **Thriller**, and **Comedy**.

###  Most Popular Movie
The highest popularity score goes to **"Spider-Man: No Way Home"**, which fits into **Action**, **Adventure**, and **Sci-Fi** genre
